# Project 1: [Face Detector:](https://github.com/Jihadmz/Face-Detector)
> The goal of this project is to make the system able to detect your face no matter of the scalability and the position of your face.
Also the system can detect as many faces are there in the image or in the video.

> This machine learning model uses **OpenCV** library of python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.
 In this project the dataset used for training the model is a bunch of humans face collected by some contributors, you can get it [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv).

# Project 2: [Stock Price Predictor:](https://github.com/Jihadmz/Stock-price-predictor)
> Its a predictor price model in which it will predict the direction of the price of a product, and for that I predicted the price of gold obtaining the data from Yahoo Finance.

> In this project I used three different models:
> - First one in **Linear Regression**
> - Second one in **Lasso Regression**
> - Third one in **Ridge Regression**

# Project 3: [Gas_Price Detector:](https://github.com/Jihadmz/Gas_Price_Detector)
> It's a machine learning model to predict the price of gas based on the dataset of gas obtained from [Yahoo's finance page](https://finance.yahoo.com/)

> In this project I used three different models:
> - First one in **Linear Regression**
> - Second one in **Lasso Regression**
> - Third one in **Ridge Regression**

# Project 4: [Average Lifespan of Animals and Humans:](https://github.com/Jihadmz/Average-lifespan-of-animals-and-humans)
> This project is about describing the average lifespan of some animals and humans, as well as comparing both species.

* There were no ready datasets for this project, so I made web scraping on this [site](https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/maths-linear-quadratic/0/steps/12167) to extract
the information from it.
